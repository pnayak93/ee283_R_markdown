##Answers to Week2 Lab Questions:

Hint Questions:
*In this block, you'll want to state that you are using reticulate. Some of you may need to also tell the system where your Python executable is:

Q: What function does that?
A: the use_python() function allows you to tell the system the path of the python executable

Q: What shell command do you use to find your Python path?
A: you can use "which python" or start the python console and find shell using: python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

Q: What does include = FALSE do?
A: include = FALSE prevents the final knitted R_markdown html file from showing the chunk of R code. It still runs the code, however, and provides the output of the code.

Level Up Question:

Q: What happens if you remove the semicolon (';') from the second to last line of the last code block?
A: When we remove the semicolon from the second to last line, python prints the object type and memory allocation space.
